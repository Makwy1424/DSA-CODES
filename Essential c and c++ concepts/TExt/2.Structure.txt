Structure=======
----------------

collection of data members of similar type or dissmilar types under one name>

It is used for user defined data types;

=======Defining structure=======
---------------------------------------

When a object is not defined by a same variable for multiple times may be, then we used a structure to define it.

ex:-
For a rectangle.

code+++

struct rectangle{
int length;           //Declaration
int breadth;
};

This declaration is declared outside main for simplicity to use the structure.

Also complex nubers are defined by using a structure.

We also include a array in a structure and pointers also. It will be.....

code:::::
struct student{
int roll;
char name[29];
char dept[90];
char adress[87];
}


The size of the structure is equal to the size of the sum of the indivisual data type varibles.

Ex:In struct student, if a variable is declared then it takes only memory ,if a variable is declared then it consumes =4+29+90+87=210 byte.


Array structures++++++++=======
------------------------
init:::struct student ten_boys[50];
decla::struct student ten_boys[50]={{1,"smruti","math","bbsr"},{2,"rana","chem","dgd"},{........}};
Assesing::::
ten_boys[0].name=Smruti
ten_boys[1].roll=2
ten_boys[1].dept=chem
