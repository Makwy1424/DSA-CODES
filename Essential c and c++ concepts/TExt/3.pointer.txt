Pointers are used to acess the value by the taking adress. 

1.The program doesn't directly acess the heap memory it is limited to main and stack memory.By using pointers we use the heap memory.

2.It can acess any file present in the computer and inter and keyboard and manymore.

3. Parameter passing in funtion.



To acess heap memory in c we use the malloc function present in <stdlib.h> .
in c=====
int *p;
p=(int*)malloc(5*sizeof(int));

in c++=====
int *p;
p=new int[5];
