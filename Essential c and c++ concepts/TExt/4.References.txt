Reference is the alias name given to a variable or some other type.

int a = 10;
int &r = a;

In the above code & sign represent the alias ya another name of a.Means the same memory they contain. It just a another name of that variable.
 
cout << a << endl; //Thyis gives the value of a
cout << r; 

The above gives same output
